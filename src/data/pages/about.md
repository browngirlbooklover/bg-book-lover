## Leslie-Ann Murray

My name is Leslie Ann Murray and I’m a fiction writer and book lover from Trinidad and Tobago. I’m currently living in Brooklyn, New York, but before living here I’ve lived in France, Bangladesh, China, South Africa, and a random small town in New England. 

I started Brown Girl Book Lover because we need more diverse book reviewers. My primary focus is to review diverse books and interview writers who are unearthing new ways for us to think.
